        <h4>Free, easy mobile fundraising and tipping</h4>
        <p>Ever felt the need to give a cash tip, but didn't have any bills? This is what lead us to work on Swiftgive. Simply stated, it's a service that allows users to scan unique QR codes from their mobile devices to tip on the spot without needing cash.  Credit card fees are astronomical for small transactions, so the system currently wraps the free Square Cash peer-to-peer payment system. We're constantly on the lookout for an alternative free-or-cheap payment system so if you know one let me know.</p>

        <h4>Free-market platform</h4>
        <p>MTGBazaar launched in 2012 as an alternative marketplace for the niche trading card game, Magic the Gathering. At the time, players were being served primarily by eBay. MTGBazaar delivered optimized search and lower fees to people across the US looking to buy and sell Magic cards. Unfortunately, due to unreconcilable differences among co-founders, the site is no longer active today.</p>

        <h4>Oilfield service and equipment ratings</h4>
        <p>Oilfield Intelligence was the first project I've worked on built with Ruby on Rails back in 2010. The idea was to create a free platform where professionals working in Oil & Gas could congregate and share reviews on service providers within the industry.</p>
