        <p>What to put here? How about a picture of me being active in the outdoors? Everybody loves when people are active in the outdoors!</p>
        <p>I would say that I'm a person who loves learning and thinking of creative solutions to problems we face on a day-to-day basis.</p>
        <p>Working in the Oil and Gas Industry requires me to expand my engineering skills and challenges me to collaborate with a wide variety of people to be successful.</p>
        <p>My roots are in computing.  I grew up playing 8-bit video games and programming silly things in Basic.  I like to keep my coding skills sharp by learning new languages and working on side projects as a creative outlet.</p>
